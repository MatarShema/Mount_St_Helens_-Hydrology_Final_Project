## **Project Overview**
This project, part of my final assignment in the Surface Hydrology course, explores the short-term and long-term impacts of the Mount St. Helens volcanic eruption on local climate variables, specifically temperature and precipitation.

## **Background**
Mount St. Helens, located in southwestern Washington state, is an active volcano within the Cascade Range. Its most notable eruption occurred on May 18, 1980, resulting in over 50 fatalities and widespread ecological destruction. The eruption produced a massive ash cloud, leading to significant temperature drops during the day and increased nighttime warming. Research indicates that global temperatures and regional climates were affected for up to 3-5 years, with variations depending on location.

## **Research Question**
*What are the short-term and long-term impacts of the volcanic eruption at Mount St. Helens on local climate variables (Temperature and Precipitation)?*

## **Methodology**
The study utilizes data from NOAA weather stations at Quinault and Paradise, chosen for their proximity to the eruption site and extensive historical records. The analysis employs Python for data processing, focusing on temperature and precipitation trends before, during, and after the eruption to identify significant climatic deviations.

## **Hypotheses**
Short-term Effects: The eruption will result in significant short-term cooling and an increase in precipitation, with cooling expected to persist for a few days.
Long-term Effects: Sustained cooling in local areas is anticipated, similar to other volcanic events, potentially lasting several years. A long-term decrease in precipitation is also hypothesized, although this effect may be less pronounced.

## **Conclusions**
**Short-term Effects:** The eruption caused a significant cooling effect a few days after the event and increased precipitation in late May 1980, influenced by local conditions.

**Long-term Effects:** Contrary to the initial hypothesis, there was a slight increase in temperature in the years following the eruption, with increased fluctuations between daily minimum and maximum temperatures. Precipitation changes were minimal, with a slight rise in winter averages.
